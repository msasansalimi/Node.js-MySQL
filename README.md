# Node.js-MySQL

## This is Home Work No.10 which I have created Amazon-like store front with the MySQL and Node.js skills.

### First I have created my bamazon data base, the products table, naming columns, and inserting 10 items in the table.
### You can check my sql database code on *bamazonSeed.sql* file. 


### In this app user can choose the required item through the provided list by app, select the quantity and recieve see
### the price. If the item is not available or insufficient, the app base on sql database information is logging insufficient
### quantity.

**Below you can see the pictures of how my app is working**
